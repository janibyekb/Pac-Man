# Pac-Man
Built Pac-Man Game with C++ and SDL 2.0 Library./includes Dijikstra's Algorithm.

As for my project, I have chosen to develop a game and I had been worked on wide-know Japanese game called “Pac-man”. Which is a sort of puzzle and arcade game that player controls the main character through an enclosed maze. And the main goal of the game is to eat or finish all the points placed on the maze while avoiding ghost or enemies.
